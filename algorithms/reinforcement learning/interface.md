`function [policy, time, policies, times, (optional...)] = <algorithm>(domain, reward)`

* output
	* `policy`   - the best generated function which takes a state and returns an action
	* `time`     - a column vector whose sum equals the entire time it took to generate the policy
	* `policies` - a cell array containing all the policies generated by the algorithm (of which `policy` is one)
    * `times`    - a matrix containing the `time` vectors for each corresponding `policy` in `policies`
	* `(optional...)` - any number of additional return values desired for an algorithm

* input
	* `domain` - a character vector indicating which domain to reference
	* `reward` - a function which takes a state and returns a decimal
