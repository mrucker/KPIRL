% new_policy = lsqbefast(samples, policy, new_policy)
%
% Evaluates the "policy" using the set of "samples", that is, it
% learns a set of weights for the basis specified in new_policy to
% form the approximate Q-value of the "policy" and the improved
% "new_policy". The approximation minimizes the bellman error.
%
% Returns the new policy with weights set to w of Aw=b.
%
% NOTE: this function can be made nearly twice as fast by caching
%       the features from the state/action pairs when not resampling
%
% See also lsqbe_mem.m for slower (incremental) implementation.
