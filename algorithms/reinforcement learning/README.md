# RL Interface

The RL interface is defined as follows:

	function [policy, time, policies, times, (optional...)] = <algorithm name>(domain, reward)
	
Where the input and output paramaters are as follows:

	* input paremeters
		* domain - a character vector indicating which domain is being solved
		* reward - a function which takes a state and returns a real number
		
	* output parameters
		* policy - the best generated function which takes a state and returns an action
		* time - a column vector whose sum equals the entire time it took to generate the policy
		* policies - a cell array containing all the policies generated by the algorithm (of which policy is one)
		* times - a matrix containing the time vectors for each corresponding policy in policies
		* (optional...) - any number of additional return values desired for an algorithm
