# IRL Interface

The IRL interface is defined as follows:

	function [reward, time, (optional...)] = <algorithm name>(domain)
	
Where the input and output paramaters are as follows:

	* output parameters
		* reward - a function which takes a state and returns a decimal
		* time - a column vector whose sum equals the entire time it took for the algorithm to run
		* (optional...) - any number of additional return values desired for an algorithm

	* input parameters
		* domain - a character vector indicating which domain is being solved
