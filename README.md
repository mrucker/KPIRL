# KPIRL-KLA
KPIRL is a non-linear extension to Abbeel and Ng's Projection IRL algorithm (detailed in "[Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015430)").

KLA is an RL algorithm created specifically to be used with KPIRL in large state/action spaces (e.g. 10^30 states with 10^3 actions).
