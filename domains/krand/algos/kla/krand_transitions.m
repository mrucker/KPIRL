    %if you read in your gridworld from your file here then you only need to read it one time
    %this will make look up super fast when the MDP takes an action, since it doesn't have
    %to read from file again. There two ways you can read in from file, one you make every element
    %in your 2d-matrix a struct. Then you can just reference the values like we did for your trajectories.
    %Unfortunately, I'm not really familiar with how to make a 2d-matrix of structs so you'd have to look
    %that up. The second option is to load a 2d matrix of numbers for every single column. Then you'd look
    %up each column values in each of the matrices. You will want to convert all the string values to numbers.
    %If you keep the string values as strings it'll take up too much memory. That's because two characters use as much memory as
    %a single number. So, for example, "primary" takes up as much memory as the vector [1,2,3] since primary has approx 6 characters.
